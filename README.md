# Masia
Gameboy Color game written in C using the GBDK.

# About
Masia is a rouge like, hack & slash type game written to run on the Gameboy Color.

# Why we're doing this
Developing on the Gameboy Color is really interesting. We're both taking a class in C at our university and thought this would be a fun way to learn how to better code in C.

# Current Version
We just started so the skeleton of the game is not even a game yet.

# Future
We will be using the Github issue tracker extensively and add new things we want to implement as well as bugs we would need to fix.

# Contributing
The code is not very mature right now. Because of that, we are not looking for any new contributers. However, after we have a very simple working version, this will definitely be a project open to other contributers.
